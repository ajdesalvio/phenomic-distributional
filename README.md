## Distributional Data Analysis Uncovers Hundreds of Novel and Heritable Phenomic Features from Temporal Cotton and Maize Drone Imagery

This repository serves as a supplementary data source for our manuscript that introduces the concept of distributional data analysis for agricultural research and will be updated throughout the preprint and publication process.
All analyses mentioned in the paper are included below as RMarkdown documents. Files needed to run the RMarkdown scripts are included in the `R files` folder. Files needed to run the python scripts are included in the `Python files` folder.

Our preprint can be found at [this biorxiv link](https://insert_link_here).

### Distributional Data Analysis - R Scripts
"AM" indicates "ANOVA Model", and "HM" indicates "heritability model" (see Table 1 in the paper)
- $\textbf{ANOVA to test Genotype × Time interaction with median VIs}$: [AM1 / HM1](https://rpubs.com/ajdesalvio/cotton_maize_anova1)
- $\textbf{ANOVA to quantify heritability and Genotype variance for each time point with median VIs}$: [AM2 / HM2](https://rpubs.com/ajdesalvio/cotton_maize_anova2)
- $\textbf{ANOVA to quantify heritability and Genotype variance for each quantile WITHIN time point}$: [AM3 / HM3](https://rpubs.com/ajdesalvio/cotton_maize_anova3)
